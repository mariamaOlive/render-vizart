        "description": "It is as if in this painting Kahlo tries on the role of wife to see how it fits. She does not focus on her identity as a painter, but instead adopts a passive and supportive role, holding the hand of her talented and acclaimed husband. It was indeed the case that during the majority of her painting career, Kahlo was viewed only in Rivera's shadow and it was not until later in life that she gained international recognition.\n\nThis early double-portrait was painted primarily to mark the celebration of Kahlo's marriage to Rivera. Whilst Rivera holds a palette and paintbrushes, symbolic of his artistic mastery, Kahlo limits her role to his wife by presenting herself slight in frame and without her artistic accouterments. Kahlo furthermore dresses in a costume typical of the Mexican woman, or [i]La Mexicana[/i], wearing a traditional red shawl known as the [i]rebozo[/i] and jade Aztec beads. The positioning of the figures echoes that of traditional marital portraiture where the wife is placed on her husband's left to indicate her lesser moral status as a woman. In a lithograph made the following year called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), the artist does hold her own palette, as though the experience of losing a fetus and not being able to create a baby shifts her determination wholly to the creation of art.\n\nFrieda gave this painting to art collector Albert Bender in gratitude for the USA entry visa he helped to acquire for Diego. Rivera had previously been refused entry into the USA due to his Communist party affiliation. In the title of this printing, Frida uses the German spelling of her name: [i]Frieda[/i]. The banner at the top of the painting proclaims: \"Here you see us, me, Frieda Kahlo, with my beloved husband Diego Rivera. I painted these portraits in the beautiful city of San Francisco California for our friend Mr. Albert Bender, and it was in the month of April of the year 1931\". When the painting was finished, a San Francisco newspaper described the work as being: \"...valuable only because it was painted by the wife of Diego Rivera \".\n\nThis painting was shown at the \"Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists\" - the first public showing of Frida's work."

Only three proofs of the twelve that she originally made are still in existence; Frida herself destroyed all the others. In the left margin, she wrote in English: “These proofs are not good nor bad considering your experience. Work harder and you will get better results\". She portrays herself standing nude with a necklace around her neck and large tears running down her cheeks. There is a fetus in her womb and beside her, connected to her by an umbilical cord, the second fetus of a larger child. Blood runs down her leg from her vagina and seeps into the earth, nourishing it and giving life to plants in the form of a child’s eyes, hands, and genitals. The waxing moon in the sky also weeps as it gazes at Frida, who is holding a heart-shaped palette in her left hand, as though painting constituted a refuge from her lost maternity.“Many things prevented the fulfillment of the desire all consider normal,” said Frida, “and nothing seemed more normal to me than to paint what I had not achieved.” On another occasion, she explained it in this way: “My painting carries within a message of pain. . . Painting completed my life. I lost three children. . . Painting replaced all of that\". [i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i] was her only incursion into lithography. It seems the technique was complicated for her and little suited to her artistic purposes."

        "description": "On 4 July 1932, Frida had a miscarriage in Detroit, after being under the supervision of her doctors, who recommended long periods of complete bed rest to bring her pregnancy to term. Her body, however, was unable to resist and she was finally taken to the Henry Ford Hospital, where an abortion was performed to finish the process that had begun at home.\nSome days later, in a state of deep depression, Frida asked to be brought the fetus of her child so that she could paint it. She was not granted her wish, having to make do with some illustrations provided by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego[/url] and her doctors, with which she began to create this work, named after the hospital in which she was cared for.\n\nMany of Kahlo's paintings from the early 1930s, especially in size, format, architectural setting, and spatial arrangement relate to religious [i]ex-voto[/i] paintings of which she and Rivera possessed a large collection ranging in the date over several centuries. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are made as a gesture of gratitude for salvation, a granted prayer or disaster averted and left in churches or at shrines. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are generally painted on small-scale metal panels and depict the incident along with the Virgin or saint to whom they are offered. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] (1932) is a good example where the artist uses the [i]ex-voto[/i] format but subverts it by placing herself center stage, rather than recording the miraculous deeds of saints. Kahlo paints her own story, as though she becomes saintly and the work is made not as thanks to the lord but in defiance, questioning why he brings her pain. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] is the first painting for which Frida used a metal sheet as a support, in the tradition of Mexican ex-votos, or votive tablets. She continued to use metal in her later works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/my-birth-1932][i]My Birth[/i][/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-along-the-boarder-line-between-mexico-and-the-united-states-1932][i]Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and The United States[/i] [/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-necklace-1933][i]Self-Portrait with Necklace[/i][/url] (1933), etc.\n\nIn [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i], Kahlo lies on a bed, bleeding after a miscarriage. From the exposed naked body six vein-like ribbons flow outwards, attached to symbols. One of these six objects is a fetus, suggesting that the ribbons could be a metaphor for umbilical cords. The other five objects that surround Frida are things that she remembers or things that she had seen in the hospital. For example, the snail makes reference to the time it took for the miscarriage to be over, whilst the flower was an actual physical object given to her by Diego. The artist demonstrates her need to be attached to all that surrounds her: to the mundane and metaphorical as much as the physical and actual. Perhaps it is through this reaching out of connectivity that the artist tries to be 'maternal', even though she is not able to have her own child. Tears pour from Frida’s eyes. There is a view of the Ford Motor Company in the industrial city of Detroit on the horizon, where Rivera was painting some murals. \n\nFrida Kahlo produced a number of portraits with the subjects in bed. This includes [i]My Birth[/i] (1932), where she captures her own birth, complete with soiled sheets that tell the story of what has just happened. Beyond that, she used a bed in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/a-few-small-nips-passionately-in-love-1935][i]A Few Small Nips[/i][/url] (1935), based on newspaper accounts of a brutal murder, related to her feelings of being ‘murdered by life’. It was timed just as Frida became aware of her husband's misdemeanors, which left her emotionally broken. Sometime in the previous year, Rivera had embarked upon an affair with her younger sister Cristina, which wounded Kahlo deeply. Rivera later commented that the paintings Kahlo made in 1932 were ‘much better than those she executed before losing her baby,’ describing her as: ‘The only artist in the history of art who tore open her chest and heart to reveal the biological truth of her feelings.’ Her dramatic scenes of pain and anguish have successfully built a strong following of support, partly due to her consistent role as the woman who was talented but also taken advantage of. Modern society is growing in support for female rights and this has helped to make Frida Kahlo a true icon, almost a martyr for the mistreated gender."

        "description": "This is a haunting painting in which both the birth giver and the birthed child seem dead. The head of the woman giving birth is shrouded in white cloth while the baby emerging from the womb appears lifeless. At the time that Kahlo painted this work, her mother had just died so it seems reasonable to assume that the shrouded funerary figure is her mother while the baby is Kahlo herself (the title supports this reading). However, Kahlo had also just lost her own child and has said that she is the covered mother figure. The Virgin of Sorrows, who hangs above the bed suggests that this is an image that overflows with maternal pain and suffering. Also though, and revealingly, Kahlo wrote in her diary, next to several small drawings of herself, 'the one who gave birth to herself ... who wrote the most wonderful poem of her life.' Similar to the lithograph [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), [i]My Birth[/i] represents Kahlo mourning for the loss of a child, but also finding the strength to make powerful art because of such trauma.\n\nThe painting is made in a [i]retablo[/i] (or votive) style (a small traditional Mexican painting derived from Catholic Church art) in which thanks would typically be given to the Madonna beneath the image. Kahlo instead leaves this section blank, as though she finds herself unable to give thanks either for her own birth or for the fact that she is now unable to give birth. The painting seems to bring the message that it is important to acknowledge that birth and death live very closely together. Many believe that [i]My Birth[/i] was heavily inspired by an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art/tlazolteotl-birthing-figure]Aztec-style sculpture of Tlazolteotl[/url], the Goddess of fertility and midwives.\n\nPopstar Madonna collected this painting. In an interview with [i]Vanity Fair[/i], Madonna said she used this painting to tell who is her friend and who is not. “If somebody doesn’t like this painting”, Madonna said, “then I know they can’t be my friend”."

        "description": "This painting represents a portrait of American capitalism and its contradictions as Frida saw them in 1933. Traveling with her husband, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego Rivera[/url], who painted commissioned murals in San Francisco, Detroit, and New York, she found herself abandoned in a culture she despised. After more than three years spent in the United States, Frida desperately wanted to go back to Mexico. But Rivera, at the time a prominent Mexican painter, wanted to stay in the United States and refused to go back. In the midst of this conflict, she painted [i]My Dress Hangs There[/i].\n\nThe painting expresses her dissatisfaction with the United States, its societal collapse, and its utter disrespect for fundamental human values. The painting is filled with the symbols of modern industrial society which treats people like machines. In contrast to this painting, Diego Rivera was working on a mural in the Rockefeller Center with which he was expressing his approval of the industrial progress in the United States.\n\n[i]My Dress Hangs There[/i], set amongst the towers of New York, makes a mockery out of the modern American obsession with sport by placing a trophy and a toilet on top of classical columns, indicating the hypocrisy of the society, stating that the achievements are valued above all else that is human. Through numerous symbols that can be found on this painting, like wrapping a dollar sign around the cross or the garbage bin, Frida highlights the dichotomy of life in New York. She presents the decay, alienation, and destroyed human values that can be seen behind the illusion of wealth.\n\nSurrounded by all this, stands Kahlo’s Tehuana dress, intact and pure. The Tehuana dress comes from the traditional costume of Zapotec women, and it became one of the main features connected not only to Kahlo's work, but to her personal fashion as well. Because Zapotec women live in a matriarchal society, their dress came to be a symbol of a female power, and thus appealed to Kahlo. She molded and fashioned the garment over time to reflect her own narrative of identity, heritage, and personal history. At the time when Mexico was trying to rediscover its indigenous heritage and promote traditional Mexican values, Kahlo, by adopting this costume into her everyday live, and through paintings such as these, developed her own brand of Mexicanidad, her own individual Mexican identity.\n\nThe absence of the central figure makes this painting atypical for Frida’s style. This painting is missing the focal point of her work, it’s missing Frida herself. She only paints her dress hanging empty and alone with the chaos of the modern city around it. With the lack of her own body in the painting, she is expressing her inner conflict. Her body might be in New York, but her soul is longing for the vibrancy of Mexico City."

        "description": "This dream-like family tree was painted on zinc rather than canvas, a choice that further highlights the artist's fascination with and collection of 18th-century and 19th-century Mexican [i]retablos[/i] (devotional folk paintings using iconography derived from traditional Catholic church art). Kahlo completed this work to accentuate both her European Jewish heritage and her Mexican background. Her paternal side, German Jewish, occupies the right side of the composition symbolized by the sea (acknowledging her father's voyage to get to Mexico), while her maternal side of Mexican descent is represented on the left by a map faintly outlining the topography of Mexico.\n\nWhile Kahlo's paintings are assertively autobiographical, she often used them to communicate transgressive or political messages: this painting was completed shortly after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adolf-hitler]Adolf Hitler[/url] passed the Nuremberg laws banning interracial marriage. Here, Kahlo simultaneously affirms her mixed heritage to confront Nazi ideology, using a format - the genealogical chart - employed by the Nazi party to determine racial purity. Beyond politics, the red ribbon used to link the family members echoes the umbilical cord that connects baby Kahlo to her mother - a motif that recurs throughout Kahlo's oeuvre."

        "description": "This painting debuted at Kahlo's exhibition in Julien Levy's New York gallery in 1938, and was one of the works that most fascinated André Breton, the founder of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The canvas in the New York show is a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] of the artist and her spider monkey, Fulang-Chang, a symbol employed as a surrogate for the children that she and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url] could not have. The arrangement of figures in the portrait signals the artist's interest in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] paintings of the Madonna and Child. After the New York exhibition, a second frame containing a mirror was added. The later inclusion of the mirror is a gesture inviting the viewer into the work: it was through looking at herself intensely in a mirror in her months spent at home after her bus accident that Kahlo first began painting portraits and delving deeper into her [i]psyche[/i]. The inclusion of the mirror, considered from this perspective, is a remarkably intimate vision into both the artist's aesthetic process and into her personal introspection.\n\nIn many of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Kahlo's self-portraits[/url], she is accompanied by monkeys, dogs, and parrots, all of which she kept as pets. Since the Middle Ages, small spider monkeys, like those kept by Kahlo, have been said to symbolize the devil, heresy, and paganism, finally coming to represent the fall of man, vice, and the embodiment of lust. These monkeys were depicted in the past as a cautionary symbol against the dangers of excessive love and the base instincts of man. Kahlo again depicts herself with her monkey in both [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-a-monkey-1938]1938[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-monkey-1940]1940[/url]. In a later version in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-small-monkey-1945]1945[/url], Kahlo paints her monkey and also her dog, [i]Xolotl[/i]. This little dog that often accompanies the artist, is named after a mythological Aztec god, known to represent lightning and death, and also to be the twin of [i]Quetzalcoatl[/i], both of who had visited the underworld. All of these pictures, including [i]Fulang-Chang and I[/i] include 'umbilical' ribbons that wrap between Kahlo's and the animal's necks. Kahlo is the Madonna and her pets become the holy (yet darkly symbolic) infant for which she longs."

        "description": "In this painting, most of Kahlo's body is obscured from view. We are unusually confronted with the foot and plug end of the bath, and with focus placed on the artist's feet. Furthermore, Kahlo adopts a birds-eye view and looks down on the water from above. Within the water, Kahlo paints an alternative [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url], one in which the more traditional facial portrait has been replaced by an array of symbols and recurring motifs. The artist includes portraits of her parents, a traditional Tehuana dress, a perforated shell, a dead hummingbird, two female lovers, a skeleton, a crumbling skyscraper, a ship set sail, and a woman drowning. This painting was featured in Breton's 1938 book on [i]Surrealism and Painting[/i] and Hayden Herrera, in her biography of Kahlo, mentions that the artist herself considered this work to have a special importance. Recalling the tapestry style painting of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance]Northern Renaissance[/url] masters, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel the Elder[/url], the figures and objects floating in the water of Kahlo's painting create an at once fantastic and real landscape of memory.\n\nKahlo discussed [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] with the Manhattan gallery owner Julien Levy, and suggested that it was a sad piece that mourned the loss of her childhood. Perhaps the strangled figure at the center is representative of the inner emotional torments experienced by Kahlo herself. It is clear from the conversation that the artist had with Levy, that Kahlo was aware of the philosophical implications of her work. In an interview with Herrera, Levy recalls, in 'a long philosophical discourse, Kahlo talked about the perspective of herself that is shown in this painting'. He further relays that 'her idea was about the image of yourself that you have because you do not see your head. The head is something that is looking but is not seen. It is what one carries around to look at life with.' The artist's head in [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] is thus appropriately replaced by the interior thoughts that occupy her mind. As well as inclusion of death by strangulation in the center of the water, there is also a labia-like flower and a cluster of pubic hair painted between Kahlo's legs. The work is quite sexual while also showing a preoccupation with destruction and death. The motif of the bathtub in art is one that has been popular since [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david]Jacques-Louis David[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-death-of-marat-1793][i]The Death of Marat[/i][/url] (1793), and was later taken up many different personalities such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman]Francesca Woodman[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tracey-emin]Tracey Emin[/url]."

        "description": "Frida Kahlo's work placed Mexican art on the international stage. Her style was figurative and self-taught, with elements of the fantastical and an emphasis on her own individual, biographical perspective. Her self-referential art, now a media phenomenon, originated in the development of her portrait painting which, from early on, became her most effective device for expressing a certain unease about exploring her own personality.\n\nIn 1938, André Breton labeled Kahlo's work as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/surrealism]surrealist[/url], leading to [i]The Two Fridas[/i] being exhibited at the [i]International Exhibition of Surrealism[/i], organized by the Gallery of Mexican Art in 1940. This double [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] is one of Kahlo's most recognized compositions and is symbolic of the artist's emotional pain experienced during her divorce from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url]. On the left, the artist is shown in modern European attire, wearing the costume from her marriage to Rivera. Throughout their marriage, given Rivera's strong nationalism, Kahlo became increasingly interested in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/indigenism]Indigenism[/url] and began to explore traditional Mexican costume, which she wears in the portrait on the right. It is the Mexican Kahlo that holds a locket with an image of Rivera. The stormy sky in the background, and the artist's bleeding heart - a fundamental symbol of Catholicism and also symbolic of Aztec ritual sacrifice - accentuate Kahlo's personal tribulation and physical pain.\n\nSymbolic elements frequently possess multiple layers of meaning in Kahlo's pictures; the recurrent theme of blood represents both metaphysical and physical suffering, gesturing also to the artist's ambivalent attitude toward accepted notions of womanhood and fertility. Although both women have their hearts exposed, the woman in the white European outfit also seems to have had her heart dissected and the artery that runs from this heart is cut and bleeding. The artery that runs from the heart of her Tehuana-costumed self remains intact because it is connected to the miniature photograph of Diego as a child. Whereas Kahlo's heart in the Mexican dress remains sustained, the European Kahlo, disconnected from her beloved Diego, bleeds profusely onto her dress. As well as being one of the artist's most famous works, this is also her largest canvas."

        "description": "This self-portrait shows Kahlo as an androgynous figure. Scholars have seen this gesture as a confrontational response to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url]'s demand for a divorce, revealing the artist's injured sense of female pride and her self-punishment for the failures of her marriage. Her masculine attire also reminds the viewer of early family photographs in which Kahlo chose to wear a suit. The cropped hair also presents a nuanced expression of the artist's identity. She holds one cut braid in her left hand while many strands of hair lie scattered on the floor. The act of cutting a braid symbolizes a rejection of girlhood and innocence, but equally can be seen as the severance of a connective cord (maybe umbilical) that binds two people or two ways of life. Either way, braids were a central element in Kahlo's identity as the traditional [i]La Mexicana[/i], and in the act of cutting off her braids, she rejects some aspect of her former identity.\n\nThe hair strewn about the floor echoes an earlier self-portrait painted as the Mexican folkloric figure [i]La Llorana,[/i] here ridding herself of these female attributes. Kahlo clutches a pair of scissors, as the discarded strands of hair become animated around her feet; the tresses appear to have a life of their own as they curl across the floor and around the legs of her chair. Above her sorrowful scene, Kahlo inscribed the lyrics and music of a song that declares cruelly, \"Look, if I loved you it was for your hair, now that you are hairless, I don't love you anymore,\" confirming Kahlo's own denunciation and rejection of her female roles.\n\nIn likely homage to Kahlo's painting, Finnish photographer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus]Elina Brotherus[/url] photographed [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus/wedding-portraits-1997][i]Wedding Portraits[/i][/url] in 1997. On the occasion of her marriage, Brotherus cuts her hair, the remains of which her new husband holds in his hands. The act of cutting one's hair symbolic of a moment of change happens in the work of other female artists too, including that of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman]Francesca Woodman[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rebecca-horn]Rebecca Horn[/url]."

As she recovered in a full body cast, her mother brought her a small lap easel, and, with a mirror over her bed, began painting self-portraits. This self-portrait embodies many elements that were in Kahlo’s artwork, including the themes of isolation, a broken body, and intense suffering and pain. This painting also embodies another one of Kahlo’s themes, that of two bodies, one of which she is a complete and full bodied woman, and another, reflecting broken insides.  "

        "description": "Later in her life, Kahlo was interested in ancient Eastern religions and mysticism, and The Little Deer is an assimilation of her Mexican and European heritage with these ancient beliefs. The image is of Kahlo’s head placed on top of a stag, which is pierced with arrows. The arrows no doubt refer to her own pain and suffering due to her injuries, as well as her injurious marriage to Diego Rivera. At the bottom of the painting, Kahlo has written “carma,” alluding to these ancient mystic beliefs. She also combines the eastern belief system with Aztec. An ancient Aztec symbol, the deer symbolized the right foot, and in this she was alluding to her injured right side, the foot of which had been crushed in a bus accident, and right leg being fractured in eleven different places. One year before her death, her right leg was amputated up to her right knee, due to complications from gangrene. "

        "description": "Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo’s marriage was tumultuous at best. Frida created this painting during a particularly low point in their marriage. Rivera was having an affair with the movie star Maria Felix, and he was rumored to ask her to marry hum. Although both of them had extramarital affairs, this one was particularly painful, as illustrated by this painting. Many times, Kahlo was able to laugh at Rivera’s indiscretions, but this painting shows real pain and suffering. She once referred to two accidents in her life; one of them being the streetcar accident, the other being Diego Rivera. "
